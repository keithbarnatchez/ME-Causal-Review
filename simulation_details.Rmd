# Simulation details

This document serves as a guide for replicating the simulation exercise in the main paper. All relevant code can be found at https://github.com/keithbarnatchez/ME-Causal-Review.

## Data generation

The simulated data is comprised of

- an outcome $Y$
- a covariate $X$ with error-prone measurements $W$
- an error-free covariate $Z$
- a binary treatment $T$

The data generating process is comprised of 4 models: 1) an outcome model, 2) a treatment model, 3) a covariate model, and 4) a measurement model.

### Outcome model

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_X X + \beta_Z Z + \beta_T T + \varepsilon, \ \ \ \varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2_\varepsilon)
$$

### Treatment model

$$
T|X,Z \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p), \ \ \text{logit}({p}) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_X X + \alpha_Z Z
$$

### Covariate model

$$
(X,Z) \sim \text{MVN}\left(\mathbf{0}, 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \rho \\
\rho & 1
\end{bmatrix}\right)
$$
We also consider the scenario where there is an instrument $V$ for $X$, in which case

$$
(X,Z,V) \sim \text{MVN}\left(\mathbf{0}, 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \rho & \psi \\
\rho & 1 & 0 \\
\psi & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}\right)
$$

By construction, note that $\varepsilon \perp V$.

### Measurement model

We assume a classical, non-differential measurement error process:

$$
W = X + U, \ \ \ U \sim N(0,\sigma^2_U)
$$
